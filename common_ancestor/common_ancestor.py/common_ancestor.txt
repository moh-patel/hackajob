Find the first (lowest) common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree without allocating any tree data structure in memory.
The first common ancestor of two nodes v and w is the lowest (i.e. deepest) node that has both v and w as descendants.
Consider the binary tree's indexes starting from 1 in the root, increasing from the leftmost node to the right at each level. (standard tree node indexing from left to right)
